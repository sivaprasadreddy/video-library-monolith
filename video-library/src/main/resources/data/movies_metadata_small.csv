Two people have a lot to say to the camera: a retired madam named Alex for whom Fleiss once worked and Fleiss's one-time boyfriend, Ivan Nagy, who introduced her to Alex. Alex and Nagy don't like each other, so the crew shuttles between them with ""she said"" and ""he said."" When they finally interview Fleiss, they spend their time reciting what Alex and Nagy have had to say and asking her reaction.",0.638211,/j9k3UTx7OZ0xoCws1oACYQZFF5N.jpg,"[{'name': 'British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)', 'id': 3324}, {'name': 'Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)', 'id': 7025}, {'name': 'Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)', 'id': 12113}, {'name': 'Cinemax Reel Life', 'id': 12911}, {'name': 'InPictures', 'id': 12912}, {'name': 'Lafayette Films', 'id': 12913}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'GB', 'name': 'United Kingdom'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'CA', 'name': 'Canada'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'DE', 'name': 'Germany'}]",1995-12-27,0,106.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,   ,Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam,False,6.8,4
